Looking like it's made of woven strands much like you might weave a basket.

This one took a few tries to get the headband size correct as it needs to shrink at a good rate and end up at a comfortable size.

I don't block all of my crochet works but it was very important for this piece for a few reasons:

- When changing from increases to decreases, the different patterns for the patchwork look would curve in different directions and this wouldn't look good when worn
- Being made out of front-post and back-post stitches, it makes for smaller dimensions than normal stitches. Blocking will stretch it out a bit.

The finished piece looks pretty good if a bit pointy on one side when worn and could perhaps have been a single row wider to sit better on larger heads.
