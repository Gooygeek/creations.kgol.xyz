After making a few other pieces using this yarn and stitch type (see the [Dragon Scale Tam](../dragon-scale-tam)), I decided that I wanted to round out the collection and make a large scarf.

I love how this turned out, it's super chunky which matches the aesthetic of the hat.

It's constructed in 3 pieces: 2 large rectangles of scales, and a centre piece to join them such that the scales point outward.

Check out how well all these pieces come together!

The gloves came first and are not my design, then the hat and finally the scarf. Just in time for winter (I finished it on Aug 23, the last week of winter ;) ).
