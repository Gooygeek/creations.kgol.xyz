A heat pack of a [blobfish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychrolutes_marcidus) in it's [disfigured form](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/worlds-ugliest-animal-blobfish-6676336/).

The pack is filled with rice (long grain or jasmine) and the lining is hand-made.

As this piece was meant to be heated up, it was important that all the bits that are likely to get particularly hot handle that heat well.
For the most part, that meant that the internals and the parts that touch it be made of natural materials that are flame-retardant.

Rice filling, 100% cotton calico lining (both fablic and thread), 100% wool yarn for the body. Only the outer parts (fins, mouth, eyes) are made of plastic (i.e. acrylic yarn).

Instructions for this piece are not ready.
Given the safety liabilities, there is some hesitation in releasing the pattern without suitable disclaimers and warnings.
It's at least safer than selling final products.
