Just a large cushion in the shape of a [blobfish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychrolutes_marcidus) in it's [disfigured form](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/worlds-ugliest-animal-blobfish-6676336/).

It is not a a removable cover as it took an existing overstuffed cushion and was crocheted around it.
This also makes publishing a pattern for it rather difficult as the size of the cusion might vary, thus the pattern is not reproducable.
