Based on the [Motley Moss Cowl](https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/motley-moss-cowl), it uses 3 colours in alternating rows and a boxy closure at the top.

It folds up into a nice flat rectangle, making it easay to store along side other pieces in the series.

As it is based on an existing pattern I will not be selling the pattern.
