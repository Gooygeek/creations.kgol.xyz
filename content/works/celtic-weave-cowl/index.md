summary: A double thick cowl with a celtic weave along the length.
---

This cowl is a combination of cable crossings boarded by waffle stitches.

It has the same pattern twice, side by side with the intention that it gets folded in half for double the thickness but still reversible.
This also means it has increased width giving more flexibility in how it can be worn.

Given it's basically a short scarf, typical designs have fastenings to keep it wrapped around the neck.
This often comes in the form of buttons that are sewn in and designated button-holes. Given a major theme of this piece is flexibility, I instead use some spare cufflinks.
This works reasonably well to get on and fasten but the cufflinks can be a little tricky to get off again as it can catch the stitches on the way out.
