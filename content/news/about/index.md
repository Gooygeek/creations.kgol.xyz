Goldsworthy Creations was but a twinkle in my eye when I first started crocheting.

It all started near the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, you could almost say I picked it up as an iso hobby.
It actually grew out of a passion for mathematics, I knew of a type of mathematical surface called a "hyperbolic surface", which in simple terms is when there is more 'space' than would normally fit.
Hyperbolic surfaces have weird properties like squares (all sides are the same length and all angles 90) with 5 sides.
When projecting hyperbolic surfaces into our real world it presents as ruffled or wavey surface that is impossible to make lay completely flat; it's simplest form is the 'saddle shape'.

Enough mathematics though, you came here for yarncraft.
Anyway, I knew that it was possible to knit or crochet such a surface and so I watched a couple of instructional videos on YouTube.
The first few pieces used scraps of yarn from around the house or that my Mum had left over from her knitting days, and look like coral (hyperbolic surfaces do look similar).
After that I did a small ambiguri of the corona virus.

At this point I was hooked (get it) and bought a bunch more yarn; making various hats, shawls, and animals for myself and others.

A few years later I have a brainwave. I'd love to sew in to my works a little fabric label, to brand my work.
I did a bit of googling and ended up buying a bunch of custom-made stain labels with a design matching this logo

I did a recall on a number of works to retrofit the new label feeling proud of having a designer brand.

After some time, I began to run out of things I wanted to crochet. Each piece I did would typically involve learning a new stitch or meeting a need.
When I was asked to make a [Tam for my Grandma](/works/braided-tam) I was initially hesitant. I didn't want to do anything 'simple' or it would have been too boring for me.
That is when I began breathing new life into my hobby by also creaating my own patterns, coming up with and testing my own designs.

Now that I was creating my own designs and some of them I could not find similar patterns elsewhere, I decided to sell them.

Now I had a designer label (literally) and store on [Ravelry.com](https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/sources/kieran-goldsworthys-ravelry-store), I wanted to create a site where I could showcase my works. Somewhere I could present photos to people when talking about my hobbies, write about my works, etc.

This site was born.
